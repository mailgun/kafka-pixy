# Kafka-Pixy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mailgun/kafka-pixy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mailgun/kafka-pixy)

Kafka-Pixy is a local aggregating HTTP proxy to Kafka messaging cluster. It is
designed to hide the complexity of the Kafka client protocol and provide a
stupid simple HTTP API that is trivial to implement in any language.

## Aggregation
Kafka works best when messages are read/written in batches, but from application
standpoint it is easier to deal with individual message read/writes. Kafka-Pixy
provides message based API to clients, but internally it collects them in
batches and submits them the way Kafka likes it the best. This behavior plays
very well with the microservice architecture, where there are usually many tiny
assorted service instances running on one beefy physical host. So Kafka-Pixy
installed on that host would aggregate messages from all the service instances,
herby effectively using the network bandwidth.

## Locality
Kafka-Pixy is intended to run on the same host as the applications using it.
Remember that it provides only message based API - no batching, therefore using
it over network is suboptimal. To encourage local usage Kafka-Pixy binds to
the Unix Domain Socket only by default. User has an option to enable a TCP
listener but that is mostly for debugging purposes.

## HTTP API

### Produce

`POST /topics/<topic>?key=<key>` - submits a message to the Kafka topic with
name **topic**, using a hash of **key** to determine the shard where the message
should go to. The body of the request represents the message that
is submitted to Kafka as is. If **key** is not specified then the message is
submitted to a random shard. Note that it is not the same as specifying an empty
key value, for empty string is a valid key value, and therefore all messages
with an empty key value go to the same shard.

E.g. if a Kafka-Pixy processes has been started with the `--tcpAddr=0.0.0.0:8080`
argument, then you can test it using **curl** as follows:

```
curl -X POST localhost:8080/topics/foo?key=bar \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"bar": "bazz"}'
```

## Command Line

Kafa-pixy accepts the following command line parameters:

 Parameter | Default                  | Description
-----------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------
 brokers   | localhost:9092           | Comma separated list of Kafka brokers. Note that these are just seed brokers. The rest brokers are discovered automatically.
 unixAddr  | /var/run/kafka-pixy.sock | Unix Domain Socket that the primary HTTP API should listen on.
 tcpAddr   |                          | TCP interface where the secondary HTTP API should listen. If not specified then Kafka-Pixy won't listen on a TCP socket.
 pidFile   | /var/run/kafka-pixy.pid  | Name of the pid file to create.
